We are reworking classic puzzles and games for learning. The games are made with web technologies for mobile phones.

Do you enjoy coding in highly performant JavaScript, working on your own and presenting the work to highly skilled colleagues?

Are you happy to collect constructive criticism to make sure that the end result is the best we can make?

Do you think that code reviews is a way to make everybody do their best work?

Do you love learning new stuff constantly?

Do you know modern browser technologies like CSS transforms, JavaScript Web Components, Canvas and WebGL?

Have you made mobile websites with touch interaction?

Have you make games using web game frameworks?

Would you like to work in an environment where we go for excellent results?

If this is you or who you would like to be, please get in touch with us. We are looking for a part time web game developer. Weâ€™ll give you a little challenge to make a super simple game prototype, and if working together is going great for everybody you can start right away.
